Humanities db/app readme, documents, and code.

I put down on paper everything I wanted to know. If you see "id" as the value, it just means it's a reference to something within the same table, or a different table.

Still some challenges that I think are a bit beyond what I'm capable of, and probably not necessary to get into, like what the date is where (not all regions changed to the gregorian calendar at the same time). There'd also have to be some functions within the model to check to make sure you're not entering an artwork by an author after the author was dead, etc.

I made it not too deep and opted for separate tables instead, so scroll down if you encounter something with just an id.
